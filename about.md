Hi, I'm Hui-Hsin Wang. Currently, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Science at Hokkaido University, focusing on Earth System Science and biogeochemistry. My research interests include paleoclimate modeling, ocean deoxygenation, and methane cycles in ancient oceans. I use geochemical proxies and statistical tools like Python to reconstruct past climate dynamics and improve our understanding of Earth's carbon and methane cycles.

Previously, I completed my M.S. at National Taiwan University in Marine Geology & Geophysics and my B.S. in Marine Biotechnology & Resources at National Sun Yat-Sen University, with a minor in Chemistry. Beyond research, I've gained teaching and industry experience as a chemistry teacher, semiconductor instructor, and process engineer at TSMC.

When I'm not in the lab or classroom, I enjoy exploring environmental issues, engaging in international programs, and documenting my thoughts and projects online. This space is where I share my story, research, and personal reflections.
